# SEEMOO Speaker Pairing Protocol

This repository contains the documentation of the Sonar pairing protocol. Additionally, a reference implementation of a server in Python as well as a client in Python and Kotlin is provided.

The pairing protocol makes sure that both devices aggree on an encryption and signing key in a safe manner.

The subdirectories contain further README files documenting the respective component in more detail.
